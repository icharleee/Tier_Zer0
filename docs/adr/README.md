# Architecture Decision Records

This directory is the permanent record of architecturally significant decisions made on ARGUS.

An ADR is required for any decision that:

- shapes the domain model, persistence strategy, or API surface;
- affects a guarantee made by the [Engineering Constitution](../foundation/ENGINEERING_CONSTITUTION.md); or
- would be expensive to reverse.

## Conventions

- One decision per file: `NNNN-short-title.md`, numbered sequentially.
- Use [`0000-template.md`](0000-template.md).
- ADRs are immutable once **Accepted** — like everything else in ARGUS, they are superseded, never rewritten. A replacing ADR links back with `Supersedes`/`Superseded by`.
- Every ADR cites the constitutional article(s) it reinforces or touches.
- Every ADR from 0008 onward records the five Architecture Review Board outcomes (Constitutional, Domain, Systems, Operational, Reversibility) — see [ADR-0008](0008-establish-arb-and-documentation-governance.md).
- ADRs are unversioned; governance documents elsewhere follow the [Governance Versioning Standard](../standards/GOVERNANCE_VERSIONING_STANDARD.md).
