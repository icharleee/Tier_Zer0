# ARGUS Domain Invariant Matrix

- **Document version:** 0.0.2 (Skeleton — population unblocked by AGC Review Session 001; completed before Task 001 per the revised roadmap)
- **Date:** 2026-07-13
- **Required by:** ADR-0006 (per-table enforcement specification and material-mutation enumeration)
- **Derived from:** the [Ontology](ONTOLOGY.md), [Domain Schema Specification](DOMAIN_SCHEMA_SPECIFICATION.md), and [Entity Lifecycles](ENTITY_LIFECYCLES.md)

The matrix maps every constitutional invariant to its concrete enforcement mechanism and its verifying release-blocking test. It is the bridge between doctrine and implementation: ADR-0006 forbids blanket enforcement rules ("not every table has the same immutability requirements") and requires enforcement to be specified per table, here.

It also carries the authoritative enumeration of **material domain mutations** — the operations whose AuditEntry emission is constitutionally mandatory (ADR-0006, validation criterion 2). Until populated, the audit events listed per entity in the Domain Schema Specification and Entity Lifecycles serve as the provisional enumeration.

## Row schema

Each row of the populated matrix will specify:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Entity / field group | The record type and the group of fields the row governs |
| Ontology rule | The stable identifier(s) of the rule(s) the row enforces (ONT-…, per ADR-0011) |
| Immutability class | CI (content-immutable) / V (versioned) / CT (controlled-transition), per spec C5 |
| Permitted mutations | The exhaustive list of allowed changes (empty for CI) |
| Permitted actors | Who may cause each mutation (spec C1) |
| Enforcing mechanism | Database role privilege / constraint / trigger / controlled function / service-layer rule — named concretely |
| Material mutations audited | The audit events emitted, atomically in-transaction |
| Verifying test | The release-blocking constitutional test that proves the enforcement (Constitution, Enforcement §3), which itself cites the row's ontology rule (ADR-0010) |

The matrix thereby closes the ODE verification loop: test → matrix row → ontology identifier → constitutional article.

## Status

Unblocked by the domain bundle's ratification (AGC Review Session 001). Per the session's revised roadmap, the matrix is populated — together with the ERD — **before** Task 001 (infrastructure scaffold), so implementation begins against a completed ontology rather than discovering one. Rows are reviewed by the Governance Council's Architecture Review Board.

## Version history

| Version | Date | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 0.0.1 | 2026-07-13 | Skeleton: row schema and population plan. Relocated from docs/architecture/ per ADR-0009. |
| 0.0.2 | 2026-07-13 | Added Ontology-rule column (ADR-0011) and ODE loop-closure semantics (ADR-0010); population re-sequenced ahead of Task 001 per AGC Session 001. |
